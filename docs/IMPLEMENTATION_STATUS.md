## Known limitations

- The backend exposes only a process-level health endpoint; no menu API exists.
- Authentication, orders, payments, Stripe, and frontend work have not started.
- The seed is restricted to the exact local development database and is not a
  production bootstrap process.
- Full-system containerisation, continuous integration, and deployment have
  not started.

## Last verification

Stage 5 verified on 2026-08-06:

- Development database migrated additively from `0001_database_baseline` to
  `0002_create_menu_models` without changing its OID: PASS
- Exact local Psycopg driver, host, port 5433, database, and credential
  allowlist: PASS

- Empty isolated test database creation without resetting development data: PASS
- First upgrade to `0002_create_menu_models`: PASS
- Downgrade to `0001_database_baseline` and removal of Stage 4 tables: PASS
- Second upgrade to `0002_create_menu_models`: PASS

- Alembic check reported no new upgrade operations: PASS
- Menu model integration suite: 43 passed
- MutableList append/remove persistence and `ON DELETE RESTRICT`: PASS

- The then-current full-suite result is superseded by the Stage 5 regression
  result recorded above.
- Ruff, Black, and isort: PASS
